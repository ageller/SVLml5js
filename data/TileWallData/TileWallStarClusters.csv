M3,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=28.3833,13.7033333,1.4,0,0",33.9 kly,180 ly,This is a rather metal rich globular cluster.
M4,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-26.53333,16.3933333,1.4,0,0",7.2 kly,70 ly,"This was one of the first globular clusters to be resolved into individual stars. It also houses one of the oldest known stars, which is a white dwarf."
M5,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=2.083333,15.31,1.4,0,0",24.5 kly,160 ly,It is one of the oldest known clusters at about 13 billion years old.
Butterfly Cluster(M6),"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-32.21666667,17.6683333333333,2.5,0,0",1.6 kly,12 ly,"This is an open cluster made primarily out of hot, bright, blue B stars. Though it's brightest star is an orange giant."
Ptolemy Cluster(M7),"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-34.81666667,17.8983333,2.2,0,0",980 ly,50 ly,It is a naked eye open cluster that has been known since ancient times. It is found near the stinger in Scorpius the Scorpion.

M10,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-4.1,16.9516666666667,1.4,0,0",14.3 kly,83.2 ly,This is a globular cluster. There is a significant fraction of binaries that live in the core since. They have migrated there due to their larger mass.
M15,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=12.16666667,21.5,1.40625,0,0",33.6 kly,175 ly,"M15 is dense collection of more than 100,000 stars known as a globular cluster. M15 is one of the oldest globular clusters with an estimated age of 12 billion years."
