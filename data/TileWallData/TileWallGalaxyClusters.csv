Abell 1689,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-1.33484540604825,13.1914731173651,0.518142928559599,0.446106156809751,0",2.5 Gly,,"This is one of the most massive concentrations of galaxies known as a galaxy cluster. The thin, curved bands you see is the light from even more distant galaxies that is bent due to Abell 1689's large amount of gravity, a phenomena known as gravitational lensing."
Bullet Cluster,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-55.9441666666667,6.97444444444444,0.800376546297105,0.223053078404873,0",3.7 Gly,,This collision between two galaxy clusters seems to have left a dark matter cluster in the space between them. The blue overlays the distribution of dark matter; the pink light shows x-rays that come from heated gas in the clusters.
CL0024+17,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=17.16194444444444,0.4430555555555555,1,0,0",,,"CL0024+17 is a cluster of galaxies located in Pisces. The blue streaks near the center of the image are the smeared images of very distant galaxies that are not part of the cluster. The distant galaxies appear distorted because their light is being bent and magnified by the powerful gravity of Cl 0024+17, an effect called gravitational lensing, which is allowing astronomers to probe the distribution of dark matter in space. While mapping the dark matter in this cluster, astronomers found a dark-matter ring near the cluster's center. The ring's discovery is among the strongest evidence that dark matter exists."
Coma Cluster,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=27.9677777777778,12.9997222222222,3.30136208582487,0,0",333 Mly,,"The Coma Cluster is a galaxy cluster made of over 1,000 galaxies grouped together. It has an array of galaxy types including spirals and ellipticals."
Hubble Deep Field,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=62.2126906363166,12.6133422810895,0.300580857107838,1.19380520836412,0",,2.5 arcminutes,"This is a very small area of the sky, but has some of the youngest and most distant galaxies known within its field of view."
Hubble Ultra Deep Field,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-27.791416666667,3.5441666666667,0.3006,1.1938,0",,2.5 arcminutes,"HUDF is an image of a small region of space located southwest of Orion in the southern-hemisphere constellation Fornax, composited from Hubble Space Telescope data accumulated over a period from 24-Sep-2003 to 16-Jan-2004. Looking back approximately 13 billion years (between 400 and 800 million years after the Big Bang), the image contains an estimated 10,000 galaxies. The rectangular image is 2.4 arcminutes to an edge, or 3.4 arcminutes diagonally. This is less than one tenth of the angular diameter of a full moon viewed from Earth, smaller than a 1 mm by 1 mm square of paper held at 1 meter away, and equal to roughly one thirteen-millionth of the total area of the sky. The upper left corner of the image points toward north (_46.4¡) on the celestial sphere."
El Gordo(STILL WORKING ON THIS),http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/wwtweb/goto.aspx?object=Image_File&ra=1.04791666666667&dec=-49.2494444444444&zoom=0.4,,,"Officially named 'ACT-CL J0102-4915', this galaxy cluster is nicknamed 'El Gordo', meaning ""the Fat One"" or ""the Big One"" in Spanish. It is located more than 7 billion light-years from Earth. (See Wikipedia - El Gordo and HubbleSite - Full Story on El Gordo.) Or El Gordo TEST?"

(RCS = Red-sequence Cluster Survey) Hubble's view of the distant background galaxy, which lies nearly 10 billion light-years away, is significantly more detailed than could be achieved without the help of the gravitational lens."
