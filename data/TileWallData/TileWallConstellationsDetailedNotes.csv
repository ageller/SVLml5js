Aries,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=20.0,3.0,0,0,0",(see Wikipedia - Aries & Teegarden's star),,"Aries, ""The Ram"", is one of the constellations of the zodiac, the groups of stars through which the apparent course of the sun passes during the year. Aries (the Latin word for ram) is located in the Northern Hemisphere between the constellations Pisces (to the west) & Taurus (to the east). Its brightest star is Hamal, & its nearest star is Teegarden's Star. As of 2002, the Sun resides in the constellation Aries from April 19 to May 20 as it moves through the ecliptic. Several meteor showers appear to radiate from Aries, incl. the Daytime Arietids & the Epsilon Arietids. Deep-sky objects: NGC 772 (an unbarred spiral galaxy w/ a notable supernova), NGC 678 & NGC 680 (a pair of galaxies only ~200,000 light-years apart), NGC 821 (an E6 elliptical galaxy, which has hints of an early spiral structure), Arp 276 (a pair of interacting galaxies NGC 935, the northern member of the pair, & IC 1801), & Segue 2 (a dwarf spheroidal galaxy that is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, recently discovered to be a potential relic of the epoch of reionization). Aries contains several stars with extrasolar planets."
Taurus,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=15,4,0,0,0",(see Wikipedia - Taurus),,"Taurus, ""The Bull"", is one of the constellations of the zodiac. Its brightest star is Aldebaran, an orange-hued, spectral class K5 III giant star. During November, the Taurid meteor shower appears to radiate from the general direction of Taurus. In the northeastern quadrant of the Taurus constellation lie the Pleiades (M45), one of the best known open clusters, easily visible to the naked eye. Also, a supernova remnant & pulsar wind nebula called the Crab Nebula (M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A)."
Gemini,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=20,7,0,0,0",(see Wikipedia - Gemini),,"Gemini, ""The Twins"", is one of the constellations of the zodiac, and it is associated with the twins Castor & Pollux in Greek mythology. Correspondingly, the two brightest stars in Gemini are named Castor & Pollux, with the brightest being Pollux. Pollux has an extrasolar planet revolving around it, as do two other stars in Gemini, HD 50554 & HD 59686. To look at Gemini is to look away from the Milky Way; as a result, there are relatively few deep-sky objects of note, incl. the Eskimo Nebula (a.k.a., Clown Face Nebula, or NGC 2392) & Medusa Nebula, the open cluster M35 (NGC 2168), & Geminga (a neutron star ~550 light years from Earth). Other objects of note are NGC 2129, NGC 2158, NGC 2266, NGC 2331, NGC 2355, and NGC 2395."
Cancer,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=20,9,0,0,0",(see Wikipedia - Cancer),,"Cancer, ""The Crab"", is one of the constellations of the zodiac. Its brightest star is Al Tarf. Cancer is best known among stargazers as the home of an open cluster called the Beehive Cluster (a.k.a. Praesepe, or Messier 44), 577 light-years from Earth. The smaller, denser open cluster Messier 67 can also be found in Cancer, 2500 light-years from Earth."
Leo,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=15,11,0,0,0",(see Wikipedia - Leo),,"Leo, ""The Lion"", is one of the constellations of the zodiac. Its brightest star is Regulus. Leo contains many bright galaxies; Messier 65, Messier 66, Messier 95, Messier 96, Messier 105, and NGC 3628 are the most famous, the first two being part of the Leo Triplet (M66 Group), a small group of spiral galaxies (M65, M66, & NGC 3628) ~35 million light-years away. The M96 Group is located physically near the Leo Triplet; these two groups may actually be separate parts of a much larger group. The Leo Ring, a cloud of hydrogen and helium gas, is found in orbit of two galaxies found within this constellation. The Leonids meteor shower occur in November, peaking on November 14–15."
Virgo,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=0,13,0,0,0",(see Wikipedia - Virgo),,"Virgo, ""The Virgin"", is one of the constellations of the zodiac. Its brightest star is Spica. There are 34 known exoplanets orbiting 28 stars in Virgo, including PSR B1257+12 (three planets), 70 Virginis (one planet), Chi Virginis (one planet), 61 Virginis (three planets), and NY Virginis (two planets). Because of the presence of a galaxy cluster (consequently called the Virgo cluster) within its borders , this constellation is especially rich in galaxies. M87 (a.k.a. Virgo A) is the largest galaxy in the Virgo cluster, & it is a major radio source, partially due to its jet of electrons being flung out of the galaxy by its central supermassive black hole (the jet is visible in several different wavelengths). Virgo also contains the Sombrero Galaxy (M104), an unbarred spiral galaxy, & the Eyes Galaxies (NGC 4435-NGC 4438, a.k.a. Arp 120), a pair of galaxies ~52 million light-years away."
Libra,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-15,15,0,0,0",(see Wikipedia - Libra),,"Libra is one of the constellations of the zodiac. Its name is Latin for ""weighing scales"". It is fairly faint, with no first magnitude stars; its brightest star is Zubeneschamali. Libra is home to a planetary system consisting of at least 6 planets around the red dwarf star Gliese 581, incl. one planet that is considered to be the first Earth-like extrasolar planet to be found within its parent star's habitable zone (for more details, see Wikipedia - Gleisa_581). Deep-sky objects: NGC 5897 (bright globular cluster)."

Ophiuchus,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=0,17,0,0,0",(see Wikipedia - Ophiuchus),,"Ophiuchus (pronounced ""Ofyookus"", Greek for ""serpent-bearer"") is one of thirteen constellations that cross the ecliptic. It has therefore been called the ""13th sign of the zodiac"". However, this confuses sign with constellation. The signs of the zodiac are a twelve-fold division of the ecliptic, so that each sign spans 30° of celestial longitude, approximately the distance the Sun travels in a month, and (in the Western tradition) are aligned with the seasons so that the March equinox falls on the boundary between Aries and Pisces. Constellations, on the other hand, are unequal in size and are based on the positions of the stars. The brightest star in Ophiuchus is Rasalhague. Barnard's Star, one of the nearest stars to the Solar System (the only stars closer are the Alpha Centauri binary star system and Proxima Centauri), lies in Ophiuchus. Other notable features incl. the Ophiuchus Superbubble and Kepler's Supernova (first observed on October 9, 1604, near _ Ophiuchi). Deep-sky objects: Ophiuchus contains several star clusters, such as IC 4665, NGC 6633, M9, M10, M12, M14, M19, M62, and M107, as well as the nebula IC 4603-4604. From 29 Nov - 17 Dec the Sun is in the constellation Ophiuchus."
Cassiopeia,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=60,1,0,0,0",(see Wikipedia - Cassiopeia),,"This constellation is named after the vain queen Cassiopeia in Greek mythology. It is easily recognizable due to its distinctive 'W' shape, formed by five bright stars. The four brightest stars of Cassiopeia are all brighter than third magnitude; Alpha Cassiopeiae, traditionally called ""Shedir"", is a double star. Cassiopeia is bordered by Andromeda to the south, Perseus to the southeast, & Cepheus to the north; it is opposite the Big Dipper, and from northern latitudes can be seen most clearly in early November. Deep-sky objects: Two open clusters, M52 (NGC 7654) & M103 (NGC 581); SN 1572 (a.k.a. Tycho's Supernova, ""B Cassiopeiae"" (B Cas), or 3C 10), which was a supernova of Type Ia, one of about eight supernovae visible to the naked eye in historical records - it burst forth in early November 1572 & was independently discovered by many individuals."

Ursa Major,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=55.38,10.67,0,0,0",(see Wikipedia - Ursa Major),,"Ursa Major (Latin: ""Larger Bear""), also known as the Great Bear, is a constellation visible throughout the year in most of the northern hemisphere. It is dominated by the widely recognized asterism known as the Big Dipper or Plough, which is a useful pointer toward north. Ursa Major contains Bode's Galaxy (M81 or NGC 3031), a large spiral galaxy with an active galactic nucleus (harboring a 70 million M_[8] supermassive black hole), which is located ~12 million light-years from Earth. Also, Cigar Galaxy (M82 or NGC 3034), a starburst galaxy ~12 million light-years away, which is ~5x as bright as the whole Milky Way. And Mayall's Object (also classified under the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies as Arp 148), which is the result of two colliding galaxies located 500 million light years away. Plus, the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101), a face-on spiral galaxy distanced 21 million light-years (six megaparsecs) away."
Ursa Minor,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=75,15,0,0,0",(see Wikipedia - Ursa Minor),,"Ursa Minor (Latin: ""Smaller Bear""), also known as the Little Bear, is a constellation in the northern sky. Like the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the name Little Dipper. Ursa Minor is notable as the location of the north celestial pole, although this will change after some centuries due to the precession of the equinoxes."
