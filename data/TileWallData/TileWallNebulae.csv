It has sometimes been referred to as the ""Eye of God"" in pop culture. Gases from the star in the surrounding space appear, from our vantage point, as if we are looking down a helix structure. The remnant central stellar core, known as a planetary nebula nucleus or PNN, is destined to become a white dwarf star. The observed glow of the central star is so energetic that it causes the previously expelled gases to brightly fluoresce. Currently, the age is estimated to be 10,600 years (+2,300 or _1,200), based solely upon a measured expansion rate of 31 km/s."
Homunculus Nebula,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-59.6847503322875,10.7510578954714,0.0463252946340543,0,0",7.5 kly,,"The Homunculus (from Latin meaning Little Man) is an emission nebula, believed to have been ejected in an enormous outburst from the massive star system Eta Carinae. Light from this event reached Earth in 1841; at that time, Eta Carinae briefly became the second-brightest star in Earth's sky, after Sirius. The ejected gas & dust have since obscured much of its light, however future eruptions remain a distinct possibility."
Horsehead Nebula,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-2.44726246635728,5.68350584408134,1.37903635195889,-1.73101755212798,0",1.5 kly,,"The Horsehead is a dark nebula that is part of a large cloud of gas currently forming new stars, known as the Orion nebula.The pink color is light coming from very hot Hydrogen."
