The blue streaks near the center of the image are the smeared images of very distant galaxies that are not part of the cluster. The distant galaxies appear distorted because their light is being bent and magnified by the powerful gravity of Cl 0024+17, an effect called gravitational lensing, which is allowing astronomers to probe the distribution of dark matter in space. While mapping the dark matter in this cluster, astronomers found a dark-matter ring near the cluster's center. The ring's discovery is among the strongest evidence that dark matter exists.","Category":"Galaxy Clusters","images":["https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4d\/Heic1401a-Abell2744-20140107.jpg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3c\/Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png"],"wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_galaxy_groups_and_clusters"}}
