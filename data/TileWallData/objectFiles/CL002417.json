The blue streaks near the center of the image are the smeared images of very distant galaxies that are not part of the cluster. The distant galaxies appear distorted because their light is being bent and magnified by the powerful gravity of Cl 0024+17, an effect called gravitational lensing, which is allowing astronomers to probe the distribution of dark matter in space. While mapping the dark matter in this cluster, astronomers found a dark-matter ring near the cluster's center. The ring's discovery is among the strongest evidence that dark matter exists.","Category":"Galaxy Clusters","images":["https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4d\/Heic1401a-Abell2744-20140107.jpg"],"captions":["Hubble Frontier Fields view of Abell 2744\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.spacetelescope.org\/images\/heic1401a\/\">http:\/\/www.spacetelescope.org\/images\/heic1401a\/<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p>This image of Abell 2744 is the first to come from Hubble's Frontier Fields observing programme, which is using the magnifying power of enormous galaxy clusters to peer deep into the distant Universe. Abell 2744, nicknamed Pandora's Cluster, is thought to have a very violent history, having formed from a cosmic pile-up of multiple galaxy clusters.\n<\/p>\nAbell 2744 is the first of six targets for an observing programme known as Frontier Fields. This three-year, 840-orbit programme will yield our deepest views of the Universe to date, using the power of Hubble to explore more distant regions of space than could otherwise be seen, by observing gravitational lensing effects around six different galaxy clusters."],"wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_galaxy_groups_and_clusters"}}
