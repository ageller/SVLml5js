NGC 602 is the designation for a particular young, bright open cluster of stars located in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy to our own Milky Way. Radiation and shock waves from the star cluster has pushed away much of the lighter surrounding gas and dust that compose the nebula known as N90, and this in turn has triggered new star formation in the ridges (or \"elephant trunks\") of the nebula. These even younger stars are still enshrouded in dust but are visible to the Spitzer Space Telescope at infrared wavelengths. The image spans about 200 light years, and a number of more distant galaxies also appear in the background."],"wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NGC_602"}}
