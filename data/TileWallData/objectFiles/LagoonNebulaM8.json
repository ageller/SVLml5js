This giant cloud of gas and dust is creating intensely bright young stars, and is home to young stellar clusters. This image is a tiny part of just one of eleven public surveys of the sky now in progress using ESO telescopes. Together these are providing a vast legacy of publicly available data for the global astronomical community."],"wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lagoon_Nebula"}}
