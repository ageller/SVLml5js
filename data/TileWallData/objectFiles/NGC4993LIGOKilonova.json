NGC 4994), an elliptical or lenticular galaxy, was discovered in 1789 by William Herschel. Several different teams of scientists used Hubble over the two weeks following the GW170817 gravitational wave event alert to observe NGC 4993. Using Hubble\u0092s high-resolution imaging capabilities they managed to get the first observational proof for a kilonova, the visible counterpart of the merging of two extremely dense objects \u0097 most likely two neutron stars.

Within 12 hours, observatories had identified the source of the event within the galaxy NGC 4993, shown in this Hubble Space Telescope image, and located an associated stellar flare called a kilonova (box). Inset: Hubble observed the kilonova fade over the course of six days.","NGC 4993 starmap near &amp;psi; Hydrae, near galaxies of NGC 4968, NGC 4970, NGC 5042, IC 4180, IC 4197 "],"wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NGC_4993"}}
