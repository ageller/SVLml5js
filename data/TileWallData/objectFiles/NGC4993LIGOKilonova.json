NGC 4994), an elliptical or lenticular galaxy, was discovered in 1789 by William Herschel. Several different teams of scientists used Hubble over the two weeks following the GW170817 gravitational wave event alert to observe NGC 4993. Using Hubble\u0092s high-resolution imaging capabilities they managed to get the first observational proof for a kilonova, the visible counterpart of the merging of two extremely dense objects \u0097 most likely two neutron stars.
