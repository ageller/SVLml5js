Like the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the name Little Dipper. Ursa Minor is notable as the location of the north celestial pole, although this will change after some centuries due to the precession of the equinoxes.","Category":"Constellations","images":["https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/89\/NGC_6217_hs-2009-25-bc-full_jpg.jpg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/72\/UrsaMinorCC.jpg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/ce\/Ursa_Major_-_Ursa_Minor_-_Polaris.jpg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3f\/Sidney_Hall_-_Urania%27s_Mirror_-_Draco_and_Ursa_Minor.jpg"],"wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ursa_Minor"}}
