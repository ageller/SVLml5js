This unique alignment gives astronomers the opportunity to measure the properties of interstellar dust in the face-on foreground galaxy (NGC3314a), which appears dark against the background galaxy (NGC 3314b). Unlike interacting galaxies, the two components of NGC3314 are physically unrelated.","Category":"Galaxies","images":["https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/6e\/Hubble_view_of_NGC_3314_-_Heic1208a.tif"],"wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NGC_3314"}}
