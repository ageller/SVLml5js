The larger of these, at the top of the picture, NGC 4438, is thought to have once been a spiral galaxy that was strongly deformed by collisions in the relatively recent past. The two galaxies belong to the Virgo Cluster and are about 50 million light-years away."],"wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eyes_Galaxies"}}
