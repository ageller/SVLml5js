Looking back approximately 13 billion years (between 400 and 800 million years after the Big Bang), the image contains an estimated 10,000 galaxies. The rectangular image is 2.4 arcminutes to an edge, or 3.4 arcminutes diagonally. This is less than one tenth of the angular diameter of a full moon viewed from Earth, smaller than a 1 mm by 1 mm square of paper held at 1 meter away, and equal to roughly one thirteen-millionth of the total area of the sky. The upper left corner of the image points toward north (_46.4\u00a1) on the celestial sphere.","Category":"Galaxy Clusters"}}
