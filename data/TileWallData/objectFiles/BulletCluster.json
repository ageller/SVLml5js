Redshift (<i>z<\/i>) = 0.3, meaning its light has wavelengths stretched by a factor of 1.3.

The gases collide, and gravitational fields of the stars and galalxies interact. When the galaxies collided, based on black-body temperture readings, the temperature reached 160 million degrees and X-rays were emitted in great intensity, claiming title of the hottest known galactic cluster.\n<\/p>\n<p>Studies of the Bullet cluster, announced in August 2006, provide the best evidence to date for the existence of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/dark_matter\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:dark matter\">dark matter<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n<p>Sister picture: <a href=\"\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Bullet_cluster_lensing.jpg\" title=\"File:Bullet cluster lensing.jpg\">image:bullet_cluster_lensing.jpg<\/a>\n<\/p>"," X-ray image (pink) superimposed over a visible light image (galaxies), with matter distribution calculated from gravitational lensing (blue)."],"wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bullet_Cluster"}}
