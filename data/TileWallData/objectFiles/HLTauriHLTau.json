The luminosity and effective temperature of HL Tauri imply that its age is less than 100,000 years. It is surrounded by a protoplanetary disk marked by dark bands visible in submillimeter radiation that may indicate a number of planets in the process of formation.

It shows the protoplanetary disc surrounding the young star HL Tauri. These new ALMA observations reveal substructures within the disc that have never been seen before and even show the possible positions of planets forming in the dark patches within the system.\n<p>About the Object\n<\/p>\n<pre>Name:           HL Tauri\nType:           \u2022 Milky Way\u00a0: Star\u00a0: Circumstellar Material\u00a0: Disk\u00a0: Protoplanetary\n                \u2022 X - Stars\nDistance:       450 light years\nConstellation:  Taurus\n<\/pre>\n<p>Coordinates\n<\/p>\n<pre>Position (RA):  4 31 38.37\nPosition (Dec): 18\u00b0 14' 0.99\"\nField of view:  0.03 x 0.03 arcminutes\nOrientation:    North is 0.0\u00b0 left of vertical\n<\/pre>\n."],"wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/HL_Tauri"}}
