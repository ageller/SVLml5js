It has sometimes been referred to as the \"Eye of God\" in pop culture. Gases from the star in the surrounding space appear, from our vantage point, as if we are looking down a helix structure. The remnant central stellar core, known as a planetary nebula nucleus or PNN, is destined to become a white dwarf star. The observed glow of the central star is so energetic that it causes the previously expelled gases to brightly fluoresce. Currently, the age is estimated to be 10,600 years (+2,300 or _1,200), based solely upon a measured expansion rate of 31 km\/s.","Category":"Nebulae"}}
