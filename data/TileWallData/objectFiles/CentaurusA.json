This is a composite of images obtained with three instruments, operating at very different wavelengths. The 870-micron submillimetre data, from LABOCA on APEX, are shown in orange. X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory are shown in blue. Visible light data from the Wide Field Imager (WFI) on the MPG\/ESO 2.2 m telescope located at La Silla, Chile, show the background stars and the galaxy\u2019s characteristic dust lane in close to \"true colour\".","Schematic diagram of the components of the Centaurus A galaxy"],"wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Centaurus_A"}}
