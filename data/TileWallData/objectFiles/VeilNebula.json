It is made up of very hot gas and is about 70 light years wide. The Veil Nebula constitutes the visible portions of the Cygnus Loop (radio source W78), a large but relatively faint supernova remnant in the constellation Cygnus.","Category":"Nebulae","images":["https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/6e\/Veil_Nebula_-_NGC6960.jpg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/5b\/Ultraviolet_image_of_the_Cygnus_Loop_Nebula_crop.jpg"],"captions":["NGC 6960 or the Veil Nebula is a cloud of heated and ionized gas and dust in the constellation Cygnus. The analysis of the emissions from the nebula indicate the presence of oxygen, sulfur, and hydrogen.
