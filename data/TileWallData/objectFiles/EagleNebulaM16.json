At the centre, the so-called \u201cPillars of Creation\u201d can be seen. This wide-field image shows not only the central pillars, but also several others in the same star-forming region, as well as a huge number of stars in front of, in, or behind the Eagle Nebula. The cluster of bright stars to the upper right is NGC 6611, home to the massive and hot stars that illuminate the pillars. The \u201cSpire\u201d \u2014 another large pillar \u2014 is in the middle left of the image.
