Light from this event reached Earth in 1841; at that time, Eta Carinae briefly became the second-brightest star in Earth's sky, after Sirius. The ejected gas & dust have since obscured much of its light, however future eruptions remain a distinct possibility.","Category":"Nebulae","images":["https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f8\/3D_Homunculus_Nebula.jpg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8b\/Detailed_look_on_Eta_Carinae.jpg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/e1\/Eta_Carinae_%28HST%29.jpg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/7c\/EtaCarinae.jpg"],"wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Homunculus_Nebula"}}
