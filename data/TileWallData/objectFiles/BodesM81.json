It is the largest galaxy in the M81 Group, a group of 34 galaxies located in the constellation Ursa Major, and lies ~11.7 Mly (3.6 Mpc) from Earth. Messier 81 is gravitationally interacting with Messier 82 and NGC 3077. Messier 81 has an active galactic nucleus, which harbors a 70 million M supermassive black hole. One supernova (SN 1993J) has been detected in Messier 81, discovered on 28 March 1993 by F. Garcia in Spain.","Category":"Galaxies","images":["https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8b\/M81.jpg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/AnttlersM81M82.jpg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4d\/Messier81_highres.jpg"],"captions":["M81 also known as Bode's Galaxy is around 12 million light years away.

The blue colors represent stellar emission observed at 3.6 \u03bcm.  The green colors represent 8 \u03bcm emission originating primarily from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the interstellar medium.  The red colors represent 24 \u03bcm emission originating from heated dust in the interstellar medium."],"wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Messier_81"}}
