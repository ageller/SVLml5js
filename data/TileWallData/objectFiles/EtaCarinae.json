The resulting picture reveals astonishing detail.\n<\/p>\n<p>Even though Eta Carinae is more than 8,000 light-years away, structures only 10 billion miles across (about the diameter of our solar system) can be distinguished. Dust lanes, tiny condensations, and strange radial streaks all appear with unprecedented clarity.\n<\/p>\n<p>Eta Carinae was observed by Hubble in September 1995 with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). Images taken through red and near-ultraviolet filters were subsequently combined to produce the color image shown. A sequence of eight exposures was necessary to cover the object's huge dynamic range: the outer ejecta blobs are 100,000 times fainter than the brilliant central star.\n<\/p>\n<p>Eta Carinae was the site of a giant outburst about 150 years ago, when it became one of the brightest stars in the southern sky. Though the star released as much visible light as a supernova explosion, it survived the outburst. Somehow, the explosion produced two polar lobes and a large thin equatorial disk, all moving outward at about 1.5 million miles per hour.\n<\/p>\n<p>The new observation shows that excess violet light escapes along the equatorial plane between the bipolar lobes. Apparently there is relatively little dusty debris between the lobes down by the star; most of the blue light is able to escape. The lobes, on the other hand, contain large amounts of dust which preferentially absorb blue light, causing the lobes to appear reddish.\n<\/p>\n<p>Estimated to be 100 times more massive than our Sun, Eta Carinae may be one of the most massive stars in our Galaxy. It radiates about five million times more power than our Sun. The star remains one of the great mysteries of stellar astronomy, and the new Hubble images raise further puzzles. Eventually, this star's outburst may provide unique clues to other, more modest stellar bipolar explosions and to hydrodynamic flows from stars in general.\n<\/p>","A 3D model of the Homunculus Nebula","X-ray, optical and infrared images of Eta Carinae (August 26, 2014)","X-rays around Eta Carinae (red is low energy, blue higher)","Eta Carinae orbit","One theory of Eta Carinae's ultimate fate is collapsing to form a black hole\u2014energy released as jets along the axis of rotation forms gamma-ray bursts.","Hubble composite of Eta Carinae showing the unusual emission spectrum (near-IR image spectrum from the HST STIS CCD)","Annotated image of Carina Nebula","Stars similar to Eta Carinae in nearby galaxies","Eta Carinae and Carina Nebula in the constellation of Carina","Hubble Space Telescope image showing the bipolar Homunculus Nebula which surrounds Eta Carinae"],"wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eta_Carinae"}}
