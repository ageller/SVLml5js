Alpha Centauri,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-60.833974444444,14.660137527778,6.7,0,0",4.37 ly (1.34 pc),1.23 solar radii (A) & 0.87 solar radii (B),"Alpha Centauri is the closest star system to the Solar System. It consists of three stars: the pair Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B and a small and faint red dwarf, Proxima Centauri, that may be gravitationally bound to the other two."
Betelgeuse,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=7.4070627777778,5.91952925,4.86901048131776,0,0",643 ly,~5 AU,This is a red supergiant in the constellation Orion. It is one of the largest known stars.
Canopus,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-52.695660555556,6.3991971944444,7,0,0",310 ly,,"This is the second brightest star in the night sky and is in the constellation Carina. It can be seen from the Southern Hemisphere. Also, based on it's distance and apparent magnitude, it is one of the most luminous stars in the Galaxy."
Eta Carinae,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-59.6847503322875,10.7510578954714,0.0463252946340543,0,0",8 kly,,"Eta Carinae is a star system with 2 stars orbiting each other, one of which is at least 100 times more massive than the sun. It is surrounded by a thick red nebula."
Fomalhaut,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-29.622222222222,22.960861111111,2.80003203845554,0,0",25.1 ly,1.8 solar radii,This is believed to be a young star that is only a few hundred million years old. Fomalhaut has a debris disk surrounding the star and a confirmed planet orbiting within that disk.
HL Tauri (HL Tau),"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=18.23268055555556,4.527343611111111,0.1,0,0",450 ly,,"HL Tauri is a very young T Tauri star in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The luminosity and effective temperature of HL Tauri imply that its age is less than 100,000 years. It is surrounded by a protoplanetary disk marked by dark bands visible in submillimeter radiation that may indicate a number of planets in the process of formation. ZOOM IN"
Polaris,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=89.264166666667,2.5301944444444,2.80003203845554,0,0",433 ly,,"This is the North Star because it is always seen due north. It is the brightest star in Ursa Minor (Little Bear, Little Dipper.)"
Pollux,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=28.026388888889,7.7553888888889,6.67158545334998,0,0",34 ly,9 solar radii,This star is one of the head of the twins in the constellation Gemini. It is twice as massive as the sun and 9 times the radius. It also has a known 2.6 Jupiter mass planet orbiting around it.
Proxima Centauri,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-62.679483611111,14.495263527778,6.7,0,0",4.25 ly,0.14 solar radii,"Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf. It may form a third component of the Alpha Centauri binary star system, but at a separation of 15,000 ± 700[19] AU its orbital period is likely greater than 500,000 years."
Sirius,"http://tilewall.adlerplanetarium.org:5050/layerApi.aspx?cmd=mode&lookat=Sky&flyto=-16.716115833333,6.7524770277778,13.8801579925229,0,0",8.6 ly,,This is the brightest star in the night sky and is in the constellation Canis Major (Big Dog). Sirius is on the collar of the dog. It also has a known companion star.
